                    <li>Increasing student numbers at university makes entry in to the graduate
                         job market very competitive. Research surveys, including those undertaken by High Flyers, 
                         highlight the large number of applications for graduate roles (sometimes as high as 70-80 
                         applications for roles on popular graduate training schemes with the big national and international organisations).</li>

                    <li>Just having a good degree is not enough to give you the best platform to compete for graduate 
                        roles - which means work experience, work placements or volunteering is absolutely essential.
                         Employers will be expecting you to have gained experience, articulate what you have gained, 
                         including skills you have developed that will be needed in their business.</li>

                    <li>The Work Experience team within Student Futures is here to help. Get in touch with your 
                        School Work Experience Officer (based in the Student Futures team) as early
                         as possible in your studies but especially by the autumn of year two in your studies.</li>

                                and to gain the knowledge, experience and skills that will make
                                you employable. Many graduate employers use the placement schemes
                                as a year-long interview and if you do well, there is a very high 
                                chance you will be employed by that organisation. Even if you are not
                                enrolled on a course with a year in industry you can normally switch to 
                                this option in your second year, spending a year on placement following
                                completion of your second year.</p>

                                looking for external employer internships and the competition for
                                places, you need to be flexible, very organised, seek advice early
                                in your first year and be clear about what you are looking for and
